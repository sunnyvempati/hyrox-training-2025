## **Key Testing Notes:**

- Don't go 100% if you feel any tweaks or pain
- These establish baselines - we'll retest in 6 weeks
- Take day-of notes on how you felt, any observations
- Sunday = complete rest before Week 1 starts Monday

**Report back with all 4 numbers and I'll use them to calibrate Week 1 training loads!**
