## Additional Context & Constraints (Aug 25, 2025)

### Sleep & Recovery
- **Sleep:** 7 hours consistently, excellent quality, wakes rested
- **Recovery Tools:** Sauna access (wants to use post-intensity for VO2 boost), cold plunge broken
- **Recovery Philosophy:** Likes progressive ramp-up vs starting too hot

### Nutrition Profile  
- **Weight:** 175 lbs
- **Approach:** Intuitive eating, good protein habits
- **Pre-workout:** Espresso
- **Post-workout:** 40-50g protein shake (banana, Greek yogurt, protein, almond milk, almond butter)

### Current Training Structure
- **Lifting:** 6 days (M/Th: Chest/Tri/Shoulders, T/F: Back/Bi, W/Sun: Legs) - misses ~1 day/week
- **Running:** Mon easy 5mi, Wed threshold (5x1200 @ 7:00/mi), Sat easy 6mi
- **Philosophy:** Higher reps with good form over max weights, especially squats

### Logistics & Constraints
- **Training Window:** 5:30-7:30am (must finish before baby wakes)
- **Sled Access:** Can get to sled gym frequently if needed
- **Travel:** London Nov 12-16 (different timezone, will find gym access)
- **Weekly Check-ins:** Wants travel/schedule updates tracked weekly

### Mental Profile
- **Motivation:** Self-improvement driven, loves the build process and mental challenges
- **Load Response:** Can handle high volume but prefers progressive ramp-up, can burn out if too aggressive
- **Coaching History:** 2 years with running coach, first Hyrox-specific program

### Programming Implications
- Must finish by 7:30am = 90min max sessions
- Sauna utilization post-intensity for VO2 adaptation
- Progressive loading approach vs shock training
- Higher frequency, moderate intensity approach vs low frequency high intensity
