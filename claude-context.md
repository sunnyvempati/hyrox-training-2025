## Additional Context & Constraints (Aug 25, 2025)

### Sleep & Recovery
- **Sleep:** 7 hours consistently, excellent quality, wakes rested
- **Recovery Tools:** Sauna access (wants to use post-intensity for VO2 boost), cold plunge broken
- **Recovery Philosophy:** Likes progressive ramp-up vs starting too hot

### Nutrition Profile  
- **Weight:** 175 lbs
- **Approach:** Intuitive eating, good protein habits
- **Pre-workout:** Espresso
- **Post-workout:** 40-50g protein shake (banana, Greek yogurt, protein, almond milk, almond butter)

### Current Training Structure
- **Lifting:** 6 days (M/Th: Chest/Tri/Shoulders, T/F: Back/Bi, W/Sun: Legs) - misses ~1 day/week
- **Running:** Mon easy 5mi, Wed threshold (5x1200 @ 7:00/mi), Sat easy 6mi
- **Philosophy:** Higher reps with good form over max weights, especially squats

### Logistics & Constraints
- **Training Window:** 5:30-7:30am (must finish before baby wakes)
- **Sled Access:** Can get to sled gym frequently if needed
- **Travel:** London Nov 12-16 (different timezone, will find gym access)
- **Weekly Check-ins:** Wants travel/schedule updates tracked weekly

### Mental Profile
- **Motivation:** Self-improvement driven, loves the build process and mental challenges
- **Load Response:** Can handle high volume but prefers progressive ramp-up, can burn out if too aggressive
- **Coaching History:** 2 years with running coach, first Hyrox-specific program

### Programming Implications
- Must finish by 7:30am = 90min max sessions
- Sauna utilization post-intensity for VO2 adaptation
- Progressive loading approach vs shock training
- Higher frequency, moderate intensity approach vs low frequency high intensity

## Changelog
- **Aug 21, 2025:** Initial context file created with baseline user assessment
- **Aug 21, 2025:** User confirmed ability to do baseline tests this week, requesting workout structure for next 3 days before program starts  
- **Aug 21, 2025:** Q1 answered - will do baseline tests. Q2 answered - sled access 2x/week, plus Tuesday 6:30am Hyrox class available at Lifetime
- **Aug 21, 2025:** Q3 answered - comfortable with 4-5 runs/week, has done 50+ mile weeks, has home cold plunge + sauna for recovery
- **Aug 21, 2025:** Q4 answered - prioritize station strength over transition speed (focus on sled pull, burpee box jump, wall balls)
- **Aug 21, 2025:** Q5 answered - values strength gains but will defer to coach, wants to do whatever needed for 1:15 goal
- **Aug 25, 2025:** Added comprehensive context from precise-data.md - sleep, nutrition, training history, logistics, and mental profile
- **Aug 25, 2025:** Created Week 1 program - conservative foundation phase with 6 training days, emphasis on skill acquisition and movement quality over intensity. Incorporated 90min time constraints, sauna utilization post-intensity, and progressive ramp-up approach. User ready to start Monday Aug 26. Clarified Monday structure: 5-10min transition break between run and strength work.
- **Aug 26, 2025:** Week 1 Day 2 (Tuesday) - Clarified sled push alternative (weighted lunges/farmer's carries) and confirmed 90s rest between all sets in skills practice day.
- **Aug 26, 2025:** User questioned Wednesday threshold + lower body design - explained race-specific fatigue simulation logic, offered modification options (10-15min transition break vs keeping as designed). User chose to keep as designed. Noted 7:00/mile pace might be aggressive - suggested starting at 7:10 and adjusting based on feel for consistent effort across intervals. Clarified treadmill vs outdoor - treadmill fine for Week 1 precise pacing, 1% incline recommended.
- **Sep 1, 2025:** Week 1 completed successfully. Key findings: RPE 5-8 range, Wednesday threshold most challenging (8/10), Mini-Hyrox smooth at 31:20 (8:00/mile pace), threshold splits 7:15/7:14/7:13, high motivation (5/5), good recovery except leg soreness post-Wednesday. Time constraint issue - needs 60-70min sessions vs 75-85min for sauna access. Needs deadlift alternative and sled substitutes still.
- **Sep 1, 2025:** Created Week 2 program with user feedback incorporated: 60-70min sessions, Bulgarian Split Squats/step-ups replacing deadlifts, heavy farmer's walks for sled push alternative, threshold progression to 7:05-7:10 pace. Extended circuit challenge and slight volume increases while maintaining time efficiency.
- **Sep 1, 2025:** User questioned farmer's walks as sled push substitute - correctly identified grip vs quad/glute loading mismatch. Recommended weighted walking lunges as better substitute for movement pattern specificity. Updated Week 2 MD file with this change.
- **Sep 1, 2025:** User questioned Tuesday legs → Wednesday threshold sequencing. Explained race-specific fatigue simulation logic and recovery patterns. Offered swap option if too aggressive given Week 1's Wednesday was hardest day (8/10 RPE). User chose to keep as designed, wants everything deliberate and understood the reasoning.
- **Sep 2, 2025:** User caught multiple programming errors - BSS on Tuesday then BSS again Wednesday, walking lunges both days, and Friday walking lunges again. Also calf raises Tue/Wed consecutive days. Fixed Wednesday BSS→hip thrusts, walking lunges→reverse lunges, Friday walking lunges→farmer's carry, Wed calf raises→wall sit. User rightfully called out quality control failures - implemented systematic exercise audit protocol for future programs.
- **Sep 8, 2025:** Week 2 completed with disruptions - missed Thursday recovery, skipped Wednesday lower body (rough night with baby), moved Saturday run to Sunday (6mi vs 7mi). Threshold excellent (4x7:04), circuit improvement (31:48), but sleep quality down (3.8/5). Still no sauna access due to time constraints. User concerned about muscle loss from reduced heavy lifting - reassured about similar weekly volume. Wants real-time communication about missed sessions for program adjustments.
- **Sep 8, 2025:** Created Week 3 with sled introduction and race-pace focus. User flagged potential issue - did Saturday's negative split run today (Sunday), questioned back-to-back race-pace exposure for Monday. Recommended making Monday easy (7:45-8:00/mile) instead of prescribed race-pace work for recovery. Updated Week 3 MD with this change. User clarified 7:45-8:00 is moderate effort, not conversational (Zone 2 closer to 8:45-9:00/mile).
- **Sep 9, 2025:** Monday completed - 5 miles only, missed upper body due to time constraints. Redistributed Monday's upper body work: 3 exercises added to Tuesday (70min total), enhanced Friday upper body finisher (8min vs 5min). Maintains weekly upper body volume. Added sled alternatives to Tuesday: sled push→weighted walking lunges (6x40m), sled pull→heavy bent-over rows (6x15 reps).
- **Sep 15, 2025:** Week 3 completed with significant disruptions - sick kid caused missed Wednesday, threshold moved to Thursday (no lifting), Friday circuit only (no upper body), missed Saturday/Sunday entirely. Sled introduction successful (100kg push/75kg pull, good mechanics). Threshold performance excellent (6:46-6:53 vs 7:00-7:05 target). Circuit 31:50 (missed sub-30 target but pace sustainable). Energy/motivation down (3.5/5). User wants muscle groups vs specific exercises, prefers wheeled sled at regular Lifetime. Travel Wed/Thu Week 4.
- **Sep 15, 2025:** User questioned lack of Zone 2 runs - noted "easy" pace (7:45-8:00/mile) is actually moderate effort, true Zone 2 is 8:45-9:00/mile. Explained Hyrox-specific intensity distribution (60% moderate, 40% hard vs traditional 80% easy, 20% hard) due to race demands, existing aerobic base, and 12-week timeframe. Offered to adjust if user wants more true Zone 2.
