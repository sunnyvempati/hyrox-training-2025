# Friday November 1st - Pre-Simulation Sharpener
*Week 10, Day 5 - 3 weeks to race*

## **Workout Philosophy**
This is a **primer workout** - designed to activate your neuromuscular system without creating fatigue. Think "sharp but fresh" for tomorrow's simulation.

**Total Time:** 45-50 minutes
**RPE Target:** 6-7/10 (controlled, never breathless)

---

## **Warm-up** (12 minutes)
- 5 min easy jog building to moderate
- Dynamic stretching sequence
- 4 x 100m strides @ 80-85% effort
  - Walk back recovery between each
  - Focus on smooth, relaxed speed

---

## **Main Set** (28 minutes)

### **Part 1: Speed Touches** (15 minutes)
**6 x 400m @ 6:10-6:20/mile pace**
- This is your threshold sweet spot
- **REST: FULL 90 seconds between each**
- Should feel smooth and controlled, never strained
- If you start feeling heavy, slow down slightly

**Execution notes:**
- These should feel almost easy - you're just waking up the legs
- Think "rhythm and relaxation" not "push and power"
- Stop if you feel any fatigue building

### **Part 2: Race-Pace Groove** (8 minutes)
**2 x 1000m @ 7:05-7:10/mile pace**
- Your target race pace
- 2 minutes easy walk/jog between
- Focus on finding that sustainable rhythm

### **Part 3: Station Activation** (5 minutes)
**Quick touches - not for time, just for movement:**
- 10 wall balls (smooth rhythm)
- 10 burpees (controlled pace)
- 200m row (race pace feel)
- 10 wall balls (finish strong)

This just reminds your body of the movements without creating fatigue.

## **Cool-down** (5-8 minutes)
- 5 min easy walk
- Light stretching
- Hydrate well for tomorrow

---

## **Pre-Simulation Reminders for Saturday**

### **Nutrition Tonight:**
- Normal dinner, nothing heavy or new
- Extra hydration throughout evening
- Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed

### **Tomorrow Morning Protocol:**
- Wake 2 hours before simulation
- Light breakfast (what you'd eat race day)
- Coffee if normal routine
- Banana 30-45 min before start
- Bring gel/carbs to practice mid-sim fueling

### **Saturday Simulation Goals:**
1. **Pacing:** Start at 7:10-7:15/mile, settle to 7:00-7:10
2. **Fueling:** Take gel after station 4 or 5
3. **Wall Balls:** Remember - 5 x 20 reps, not all at once
4. **Mental:** This is your final race rehearsal - practice everything

---

## **Alternative Option**
If you're feeling ANY fatigue from today's 60-min workout, do this instead:

**Recovery Shakeout (30 minutes):**
- 20 min easy run @ 8:00-8:30/mile
- 5 x 100m strides @ 75% effort
- 5 min walk
- Light stretching

Sometimes less is more, especially 3 weeks out from race day.

## **Coach's Note**
You've had a great build phase - the Mini-Hyrox sim "not feeling bad at all" shows your fitness is peaking perfectly. Tomorrow's simulation is about proving you can execute your race plan:

- **If you hit 65-68 minutes without sleds** = you're golden for 1:15
- **Focus on consistent pacing** over trying to PR the simulation
- **Practice your fueling and wall ball strategy**

The hard work is done. Now we're just sharpening the sword!

Text me after tomorrow's sim with your time and how it felt. Sunday is complete rest - you've earned it.
