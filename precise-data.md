   7 hrs a night, consistently
2. Sleep quality - do you wake up feeling rested?
   well rested, yes. have always been a good sleeper.
3. You mentioned cold plunge + sauna access - how often do you currently use these?
   currently cold plunge is broken and needs to get fixed, but i'd like to use the sauna as a tool for recovery and also it seems there's data now that using sauna right after intensity is a good way to boost vo2 max, so would like to use it in that way

Logistics & Constraints

1. How far is the sled-equipped Lifetime from your main gym?
   not far, i can go more often if neededl
2. Any upcoming travel/work conflicts in the 12 weeks?
   not sure yet but keep asking me weekly, things might change. i am going to london (different timezone) from nov 12th night - 16th. unfortunate timing but have to do it. i should have access to a gym or i can find one.
3. How early can you train in the mornings?
   5:30/6 am. the goal is to finish training before 7:30.
4. Partner/family considerations for training time?
   yes listed above. need to be done in the AM before baby wake up.

Injury/Movement History

1. Any past injuries that occasionally flare up?
   none
2. Movement patterns you know you're weak in?
   pretty average on all hah.
3. Any exercises you avoid or modify?
   i don't love doing insane weights on squats, i don't want to cause injury due to too much weight breaking form for whatever reason. i'd rather do more reps with nice deep stretch than massive weights in general.

Mental/Motivation

1. What drives you most - competition, self-improvement, or specific challenges?
   self-improvement mostly; i love the build process and seeing my body change, and overcoming mentally challenging moments.
2. How do you respond to high training loads mentally?
   i like the challenge, but i also can get burnt out if done too much. i also like to ramp up progressively instead of starting too quickly and too hot. but i don't shy away from load, my body can take it, i want to hit my goal.
3. Past experience with structured programs vs self-coached?
   i've had a running coach for the last 2 years, but never hyrox specific coach. you're. my first

These answers will help me calibrate intensity, volume, recovery protocols, and ensure the program fits your life seamlessly.
