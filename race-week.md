## **RACE EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Pacing Strategy**
Based on your 1:11:42 simulation:

**Running Segments:**
- **Runs 1-2:** 4:25-4:30/km (7:10-7:15/mile) - conservative start
- **Runs 3-5:** 4:20-4:25/km (7:00-7:10/mile) - find rhythm
- **Run 6-7:** 4:25-4:35/km (7:10-7:25/mile) - maintain after fatigue
- **Run 8:** Everything you've got!
