starting this coming monday, 12 weeks is exactly left till hyrox event. 24. How do you prefer to track progress (daily check-ins, weekly summaries)?
maybe create a folder project, then create md files for each week. i can fill out RPE, whatever else you need to know to plan the next week. Include any recovery suggestions if volume is higher on different days, keep your notes in the md file for me to reference

Some other notes:

- Give me some general tips for nutrition in the md file (mostly macros, i’ll try to follow it as close as possible)
- Add a section for me to add any notes for the week after, like if i’m traveling, if i can’t workout specific days, etc.
- I’d like you to research other hyrox programs that have been built, and notes from guys like Rich ryan, hunter, nick bare, anyone else that makes sense for the research. the rmr program i’ve heard is really good.
- Any data you need to get more precision for creating the next week’s training program, ask for it in the md file. i wear a coros watch so can input any of that idea you need.
- This is the Hyrox men’s open nov 22nd 2025. no travel, it’s a local event.
- make sure to figure out tapering as we get close as well.
- giving you a lot of responsibility make me proud
