# **Data Requests - Please Provide Weekly**

- [ ] Average resting HR
- [ ] HRV trend (if tracked)
- [ ] Sleep metrics (duration/quality score)

## **Subjective Measures**

- [x] Which workout felt hardest? wednesday for sure, going from threshold to legs. although the leg workout wasn't too long which made it easier.
- [x] Any movements/exercises that felt awkward? not really, i'm not a huge fan of deadlifts, subsituting that would be good.
- [x] Energy/motivation trends through the week? good! first week, definitely wanted to hit every workout and get as close to the metrics you have.
- [x] Any minor aches/pains developing? just soreness

# **Your Notes Section**

_Use this space for schedule changes, travel, how you felt, insights, questions for next week, etc._

**Schedule Changes:**

- no schedule changes
- **How I Felt This Week:**

- felt really good, workload felt good, feeling decently recovered with sunday off.
- **Questions/Observations for Coach:**

- i haven't been able to sauna b.c time has been tight in the morning since i have to be home by 7:30. will try to wake up earlier, but if its possible to make workouts slightly shorter but still impactful, that would be helpful but only if it makes sense. i'm happy to make the adjustments needed to hit the workouts.
- **Looking Ahead to Week 2:**

- it would be helpful to have a substitute for the sled pull/push still as i have not been to the other gym yet. just in case i don't make it there.
- ***

  _Next week we'll increase Hyrox-specific volume slightly and introduce sled pull practice. Keep this conservative approach - we're building a foundation for 11 more weeks of progression._
