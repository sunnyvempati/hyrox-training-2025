# **Weekly Tracking & Notes**

## **RPE Tracking** (Rate each session 1-10)

- [ ] Monday: 7/10 - Upper/Running
- [ ] Tuesday: 6.5/10 - Skills + Lower
- [ ] Wednesday: 7/10 - Threshold/Lower (i didn't do lower, had a rough night with baby so just went and did this on the treadmill in the afternoon)
- [ ] Thursday: 5/10 - Recovery (didn't do it, had a light cold and felt a bit weak and was htinking of doing it sunday)
- [ ] Friday: 7/10 - Extended Circuit
- [ ] Saturday: 7.5/10 - Progressive Long Run (only ran 6 and did it on sunday; saturday was super rainy and i just got lazy tbh after not doing it in the morning)

## **Recovery Indicators**

- [x] Sleep Quality (1-5): 3.8 (had a few 6 hr/night days)
- [x] Energy Levels (1-5): 4
- [x] Muscle Soreness (1-5): 3
- [x] Motivation (1-5): 5

## **Performance Notes**

**Threshold Wednesday:**

- 1200m splits: 7:04 / 7:04 / 7:04 / 7:04
- How did 7:05-7:10 pace feel? it was on the treadmill which i feel is easier than outside but hyrox is indoor so maybe its ok?

**Extended Circuit Friday:**

- Total time: 31:48 (i paused during transition to treadmill because i had to walk quite far and didn't want to run through gym looking ridiculous)
- Biggest improvement from Week 1: went faster on the treadmill and generally the whole circuit felt smooth, was never redlining
- Most challenging new element: the runs are tough

# **Data Requests - Please Provide Weekly**

## **Subjective Measures**

- [ ] How did the exercise substitutions feel (BSS, weighted walking lunges)? felt good! help me build the muscles required to make me ready
- [ ] Did the shorter sessions help with sauna access? i still didn't do the sauna, always in a time crunch in the morning it seems. have to be back by 7:30 am to wake up my baby.
- [ ] Any movements feeling more natural/smooth? most felt good.
- [ ] Energy/motivation trends? can't wait for week 3!

# **Your Notes Section**

_Use this space for schedule changes, travel, how you felt, insights, questions for next week, etc._

**Schedule Changes:**

-
- **How I Felt This Week:**

- i missed the thursday workout and had a rough tuesday night with baby which affected wednesday where i didn't do legs.
- i also had to skip saturday and did the negative split run sunday and ran only 6 miles instead of 7. not the greatest week, but still moved the needle hopefully.
- looking to be more consistent week 3

**Questions/Observations for Coach:**

- does it make more sense to let you know about when i'm missing a workout or didn't do something so you can adjust the plan for rest of the week? what works best?
- i was doing progressive overload with my entire body resistance training before this; i built some decent muscle doing that, and i'm wondering if like im losing my gains by not lifting as much as i was. i mean ofcourse hyrox first, but not losing muscle is ideal. maybe i'm using it in different ways so they're still active. anyway, just an observation, i don't want you to over correct here either.

**Looking Ahead to Week 3:**

- i'm ready!
- ***

  _Week 3 we'll introduce sled work (planning gym visit) and add more race-pace running segments. The foundation is building perfectly - trust the process._
