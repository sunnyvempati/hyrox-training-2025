- [ ] Muscle Soreness (1-5): 1
- [ ] Motivation (1-5): 3.5

## **Performance Notes**

**Tuesday - First Sled Experience:**

- Sled Push weight used: 100kg
- Sled Pull weight used: 75kg
- How did sled mechanics feel? really good, felt smooth this time.
- Which was more challenging? push weirdly enough, the turf was odd

**Wednesday Threshold:**

- 1000m splits: 6:48 / 6:53 / 6:46 / 6:51 / 6:47
- How did 7:00-7:05 pace feel vs Week 2? did it on the track, i was donezo by the end, but felt decently smooth.

**Friday Race Simulation:**

- Total time: 31:50 (pretty tough)
- Target pace (7:30/mile) sustainability: was able to sustain it pretty well even after the stations
- Most limiting factor: the burpees maybe could be faster to make up time? the rest felt decently quick. not sure it woulda moved the needle

# **Nutrition Guidance - Week 3**

- **Protein:** 140-160g daily
- **Carbs:** 325-375g daily (+25g for increased intensity)
- **Fats:** 70-90g daily
- **Total Calories:** ~2,700-2,900 (+100 calories)

## **Week 3 Focus**

- **Tuesday (Sled Day):** Extra banana pre-workout + post-workout carbs
- **Friday (Race Sim):** 15-20g carbs mid-workout if needed
- **Recovery:** Prioritize carbs within 2 hours of high-intensity days

---

# **Data Requests - Please Provide Weekly**

## **Coros Watch Metrics** (if available)

- [ ] Weekly training load vs Week 2
- [ ] Average/max HR during race-pace segments
- [ ] Sleep metrics (especially after sled day)
- [ ] Any HRV changes with increased intensity

## **Subjective Measures**

- [ ] How did your first real sled experience feel? it felt good, want to keep doing more but the turf is kinda meh and the machine is pretty old. wonder if i should find a different spot. there's also a "sled" that's kinda on wheels and there's bars for holding at all four corners and you can add plates to the middle, its similar so not sure if that's a good alternative but its much more modern and at my usual lifetime.
- [ ] Race-pace (7:30/mile) sustainability - too easy/hard/just right? was on a treadmill so felt more sustainable than outside, not sure.
- [ ] Any muscle groups feeling more/less challenged? arms get tired faster than legs on wallballs.
- [ ] Energy levels with increased carb intake? i feel great tbh, might be eating too much possibly.
- [ ] Motivation for sled gym visits? not that high as it wasn't amazing equipment but def better than nothing.

# **Your Notes Section**

_Use this space for schedule changes, travel, how you felt, insights, questions for next week, etc._

**Schedule Changes:**

- will be traveling wed & thurs, can workout and run outside (not sure about gym access though)
- **How I Felt This Week:**

- i feel good but i also had a sick kid so i did not workout on wednesday, did the threshold run on thurs (no additional lift), then friday did the hyrox simulation but didn't do any lifting after due to time constraints, and completely missed saturday and sunday. i'm bummed but i'm ready to get back on track this week and push it. even with travel my goal is not miss any workout.
- **Questions/Observations for Coach:**

- instead of being prescriptive about which exercise (for resistance training) to do, give me the muscle group and a couple examples, i have plenty i like for each muscle, so give me very effective ones and i can pick.
- **Looking Ahead to Week 4:**

-
- ***

  _Week 4 will increase sled frequency and introduce longer race-pace segments. Your body is adapting perfectly - the foundation work is paying off._
