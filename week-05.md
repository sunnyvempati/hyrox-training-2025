## **Performance Notes**

**Monday Recovery:**

- How did legs feel after Sunday's 9-miler? pretty tired legs, i didn't hit my paces, legs were feelin' it. its sunday night now and my legs are a bit sore for sure (especially calves, shins, achilles)
- Upper body session completion rate: i did monday's but thats about it

**Tuesday Sled + Circuit:**

- Sled load used (Push/Pull): 250lbs / 250lbs
- Skills circuit rounds: 4:05 / 4:12 / 4:11 (target: sub-6min each), i only did normal burpee, the boxes were all taken for the box jumps.

**Friday 31-32 MINUTE TARGET:**

- **Total time: 36:18** (i was moving the entire time, maybe transitions? i think your math might be wrong, feel like i was moving always including treadmill run of the pace you mentioned 7:09)
- **Pace (7:05-7:10/mile) sustainability: it was good but again, it was treadmill so meh, feel like treadmill is easier**
- **Hit 31-32 minute target? NO**
- **Biggest limiting factor: just the workload, pretty gassed after wallballs**

**Saturday Tempo:**

- 4-mile tempo pace average: 7:50
- Sustainability of 7:10-7:20 pace: just wasn't my day, my legs were pretty sore, still pushed it and did my best.

- **Questions/Observations for Coach:**

- i want to keep sunday mornings for the long tempo run. i've been doing hyrox sim friday, off saturday, then come up strong for the tempo run on sunday. it does mean monday i can't go super fast again.
- **Looking Ahead to Week 6:**

- i'd like to start a bit slow, my legs are definitely feeling it, and then ramp up by end of week depending on if my legs are recovering well. i'll try to add in a massage or more hyperice legs.

  _Week 6 will focus on race simulation and peak preparation. If you break 30 minutes this week, we'll know you're ready for the 1:15 goal._
