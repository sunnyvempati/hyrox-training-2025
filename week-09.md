# Week 9: Final Build - Station Endurance Focus
*October 21-27, 2025*
*4.5 weeks to race - Last hard push before taper*

## **Simulation Analysis**
Your 63-minute performance WITHOUT sleds projects to ~73-75 minutes with sleds - that's ON TARGET for 1:15!

**Key Findings:**
- Running pace (7:30) needs to drop to 7:00-7:15
- Station endurance broke down at end (wall balls were brutal)
- HR hit 180 bpm = you gave maximum effort
- Fueling was suboptimal - easy fix for race day

**The Plan:** Build station endurance while sharpening run speed. One more hard week then we taper.

## **Monday - COMPLETED**
✓ Full upper body session

## **Tuesday - COMPLETED**
✓ Rest day (good recovery choice)

# **Race Strategy Development**

## **Pacing Plan**
Based on your simulation, here's your race-day pacing strategy:

**Running Segments:**
- First 3 runs: 7:10-7:15/mile (conservative start)
- Middle 3 runs: 7:05-7:10/mile (settle into rhythm)
- Last 2 runs: 7:00-7:10/mile (whatever you have left)

**Station Strategy:**
- Don't go out too hot on ski/row
- Break wall balls early (20-20-20-20-20 vs trying 30s)
- Steady rhythm on burpees (no sprinting)
- Quick transitions (practice putting weights down and moving)

## **Fueling Protocol**
**Race Morning (5:30am start):**
- 3:30am: Normal breakfast (oatmeal + banana + protein)
- 4:30am: Coffee + small banana
- 5:00am: 8-12oz water, then stop drinking
- 5:15am: Warm-up begins

**During Race:**
- Station 4 (after burpees): Gel or 15-20g carbs
- Sip water at stations if needed
- Post-race: Recovery shake within 20 minutes

# **Coach Notes**

Your simulation was actually EXCELLENT:
- 63 minutes without sleds = ~73-75 with sleds
- That puts you right on target for 1:15!
- Running speed just needs a small improvement
- Station endurance is the main focus now

**This Week's Mission:**
1. Prove you can run 7:00-7:15 pace consistently
2. Build endurance for late-race stations
3. Practice your fueling strategy
4. One more hard push before we back off

You're closer than you think. The fitness is there - now we fine-tune!
