- Prep for tomorrow's sim
- Early to bed

---

## **Sunday - FULL HYROX SIMULATION**
*The Final Dress Rehearsal*

### Pre-Sim Protocol
**2 hours before:**
- Normal breakfast (what you'll eat race day)
- Hydrate

**1 hour before:**
- Banana + coffee
- Stop drinking 20 min before start

**Warm-up (15 min):**
- 8 min progressive jog
- Dynamic stretching
- 3 x 100m @ race pace

### **FULL SIMULATION**
Complete all 8 stations + 8 x 1km runs

**Pacing Strategy:**
- Runs 1-3: 7:10-7:15/mile (conservative start)
- Runs 4-6: 7:00-7:10/mile (settle in)
- Runs 7-8: Whatever you have left

**Station Strategy:**
- Ski/Row: 85-90% effort (not 100%!)
- Sleds: Steady, don't sprint
- Burpees: Consistent rhythm
- Wall balls: 5 x 20 with breaks

**Fueling:**
- Gel/carbs after station 5
- Sip water if needed at stations

**TARGET: 72-75 minutes**
(This would = 1:12-1:15 on race day!)

### Post-Sim
- Cool down walk
- Full stretching
- Recovery shake immediately
- Notes on what worked/didn't

---

## **Week 11 Key Metrics**

**Tuesday Race Pace Feel (1-10):**
- Should be 6-7/10 (sustainable)

**Wednesday Threshold Feel:**
- Should feel smooth, not struggling

**Sunday Full Sim:**
- Target: 72-75 minutes
- If you hit this, 1:15 is LOCKED

---

## **Nutrition This Week**

**Mon-Wed:** Normal eating
**Thursday:** Start increasing carbs slightly
**Friday:** Higher carb intake
**Saturday:** Full carb load (nothing new!)
**Sunday:** Race-day nutrition practice

---

## **Mental Preparation**

You crushed 56:11 without sleds. That projects to exactly where you need to be.

**Confidence Builders:**
- Threshold pace (6:10-6:20) is dialed
- You can hold 7:00-7:10 pace when fresh
- Station endurance has improved massively
- Recovery between sessions is excellent

**Sunday's Sim Goals:**
1. Prove you can execute the full race
2. Practice everything (pacing, fueling, transitions)
3. Build massive confidence for race day

---

## **Looking Ahead**

### **Week 12 (Nov 11-17) - London Travel Week**
- Maintenance only
- 3-4 short sessions
- Hotel gym/running workouts
- Time zone management

### **Race Week (Nov 18-22)**
- Monday: Easy shakeout
- Tuesday: Race pace touches
- Wednesday: Rest
- Thursday: 20 min easy + strides
- Friday: RACE DAY! 💪

## **Coach Notes**

Your 56:11 performance shows you're peaking perfectly. The projected 75-78 minute full time puts you RIGHT on target for 1:15.

**This week is about:**
- Staying sharp without getting tired
- Building confidence with race pace work
- One final full rehearsal on Sunday
- Starting the taper properly

**Remember:** The hay is in the barn. You've done the work. Now we just maintain and execute.

After Sunday's sim, you'll have complete confidence that 1:15 is achievable. London week will be easy maintenance, then you'll arrive at the start line fresh, fit, and ready to PR!
