# Week 6: Recovery Ramp & Circuit Efficiency (Grok Version)

_September 30 - October 6, 2025_

## **Week Overview**

**Focus:** Start with recovery emphasis to address Week 5 soreness (shins/achilles/calves), then ramp into circuit efficiency drills and race-pace sustainability. Drawing from Hyrox methodologies like RMR's progressive simulations, Rich Ryan's emphasis on metabolic conditioning, Hunter McIntyre's high-intensity intervals, and Nick Bare's balanced strength-running hybrid, we'll prioritize realistic targets—aiming for 34-35min circuits (factoring in transitions) vs over-ambitious sub-30s. This bridges your current 36min reality toward 1:15 goal pace (needing ~28-30min circuits eventually).

**Training Days:** 6 days (Monday-Saturday, with Sunday long run per your preference—I've shifted the schedule: Friday sim, Saturday rest, Sunday long).  
**Weekly Volume:** ~7.5 hours (slightly reduced for recovery).  
**Intensity Distribution:** 65% easy/moderate, 35% hard (more Zone 2 early week).  
**Session Length:** 55-70 minutes (time for sauna where possible).

**Light Upper Body:** (20 min)  
Choose 1 from each group (lighter weights, focus on form/mobility):

**Pull:** 3 sets x 10-12 reps (e.g., bent-over rows, lat pulldowns).  
**Shoulders/Arms:** 3 sets x 10 reps (e.g., lateral raises, tricep extensions).

**Cool-down + Recovery:** 10 min walk + targeted stretching (calves, achilles). Sauna 10-15 min if time allows.

**Notes:** Easy start to ramp recovery—monitor soreness.

_5 min transition._

**Core + Stability:** (15 min)  
Choose 3:

- Planks (45s), dead bugs (12/side), mountain climbers (30s).
- 4 rounds, 15s rest.

**Lower Finisher:** 3 sets x 10 each leg (e.g., glute bridges, calf raises)—gentle for soreness.
